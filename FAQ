* How to define the default account?

  ln -s ~/.dmc/acc.default ~/.dmc/acc/myaccount

* How to 'unpack' the attachment files of a mail?

  cd ~/.dmc/box/myaccount/inbox
  mkdir mail-001.d
  cd mail-001.d

* How to send emails using msmtp?

  The current implementation of dmc only supports msmtp for sending emails.
  To use this method run 'dmc -e accountname' and change the SEND variable
  to be '!msmtp'. Remember to have your ~/.msmtprc in 0600 perms with:

    defaults
    
    account radare
    user pancake
    auth login
    from pancake@radare.org
    password popisapop
    host radare.org

    account default : radare

* How can I get a pop3/imap4 shell?

  $ dmc-imap4 fifo | openssl s_client -quiet -host yourhost -port 993 > fifo

  $ dmc-pop3 fifo | nc yourhost -port 110 > fifo

  cat mail.txt | dmc-pack file1.zip file2.zip > mail.eml

  ~/.dmc/signature

  if ~/.dmc/box/$NAME}/signature exists rules before the global one
